# Work In Progress

#### PROJECT SCOPE

This is the freeCodeCamp project *"Build a Survey Form"* - 
which has to meet specific requirements. 

I have created the Member Registration Form of the imaginary fitness club 
called Marvel Fitness, which includes all the features of the survey form project specs.<br>

I have completed most of the HTML and CSS and currently working on the responsive features.
