#### PROJECT SCOPE

This is the freeCodeCamp project *"Build a Survey Form"* - 
which has to meet specific requirements. 

I have created the Member Registration Form of the imaginary fitness club 
called Marvel Fitness, which includes all the features of the survey form project specs.<br>

This is the first project where I used the design for mobile first approach.<br>
It helped to simplify my code and the media queries and achieve smoother transitions.
