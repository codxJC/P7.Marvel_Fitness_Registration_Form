# Work In Progress

#### PROJECT SCOPE

This is the freeCodeCamp project *"Build a Survey Form"* - 
which has to meet specific specifications. 

I have created the Member Registration Form of the imaginary fitness club 
called Marvel Fitness, which includes all the features of the survey form.

I have completed the draft HTML version and working on the CSS file.
